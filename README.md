Comment-flagging system proposition

Run the script file ```python script.py```

The output will be dumped to output.txt in the same (current) directory, in the format

```
<input_file_name>:<score>
```

The file ```trie.py``` contains the object-oriented code for defining a Trie structure for storing phrases
The file ```kmp.py``` defines a class KMP for pattern searching in a given string. (This is not used in the final solution, nevertheless)
